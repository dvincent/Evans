Calendar applications test cases.

Take care with this.  I have yet to find a calendar app that handles this file well.  

Apple Calendar took a long time to process it, and failed to search it.

Outlook seems to stop working with dates past 2110.

Tested iCal 5.0.3 on Mac OS X Lion 10.7.5.  Could not go to the year 3535.  

Tested Google Calendar on 10 March 2016.  Could not go past the year 2050.  These tests were nothing to do with the ICS file, just of the calendar applications.
